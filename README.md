# SmartThermostatProject
A prototype smart thermostat using a Texas Instruments CC3220S Launchpad

    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project involved creating a program for a prototype smart thermostat using the Texas Instruments CS3220s Lanchpad. The goal was to make a thermostat with a setpoint that can be raised or lowered by a user. In order to mimic sending data to a cloud server, the prototype had to output data to the console every second. There is also an LED used to indicate whether or not the heater is on.
  
    What did you do particularly well?
  I used functions, interrupts, timers, and task scheduling well.

    Where could you improve?
  I could improve in how robust my code is. It feels too "hard-coded" to me. I think it could be cleaned up further to make it more efficient.

    What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  This is my first real embedded programming class and large project. It has really changed the way I think about embedded software and has especially changed the way I approach and plan projects. I will definitely spend more time planning on all of my future projects.

    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  Embedded programming requires very strict, clean code and a lot of planning to make sure you're not introducing bugs and/or using too much memory/resources. The attention to detail required for embedded programming will follow me into other projects and courses.

    How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable through the use of clear comments and variable/function names.
